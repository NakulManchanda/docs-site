# Raising a Zowe Application Framework issue on GitHub

When necessary, you can raise GitHub issues against the Zowe zlux core repository [here](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues). It is suggested that you use either the bug or enhancement template.

If you have an issue regarding any particular application like [Code Editor](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-editor/issues), [JES Explorer](https://github.com/zowe/explorer-jes/issues), raise an issue under specific application project.

## Raising a bug report

Please provide as much of the information listed on [Troubleshooting Framework](app-troubleshoot.md) as is reasonable. Anyone working on the issue might need to request this and other information if it is not supplied initially. A description of the error and how it can be reproduced is the most important information.

## Raising an enhancement report

Enhancement reports are just as important to the Zowe project as bug reports. Enhancement reports should be clear and detailed requirements for a potential enhancement.
